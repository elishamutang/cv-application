# Notes for myself.

1. Complete the app
2. Thinking of implementing the following features:

   1. ~~Add/remove bullet points.~~
   2. ~~Add/remove additional sections (ensure Education, Experience and Skills remain at a minimum).~~
   3. ~~Move sections up/down.~~
   4. ~~Delete field if user leaves as blank (in SkillsAndInterests component).~~
   5. Add a hover effect on section when user hovers over Remove button.
   6. Add focus on new entry for SkillsAndInterests component (either add focus or just add placeholder).
   7. Add Editing / Viewing mode.
   8. Print to PDF.
   9. Share to others.
   10. Email to yourself.

3. Bugs
   1. ~~Fix education-section sizing issue when removing bullet points.~~
