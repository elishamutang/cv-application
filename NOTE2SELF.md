# Notes for myself.

1. Complete the app
2. Thinking of implementing the following features:

   1. ~~Add/remove bullet points.~~
   2. ~~Add/remove additional sections (ensure Education, Experience and Skills remain at a minimum).~~
   3. ~~Move sections up/down.~~
   4. ~~Delete field if user leaves as blank (in SkillsAndInterests component).~~
   5. ~~Add focus on new entry for SkillsAndInterests component (either add focus or just add placeholder).~~
   6. ~~Utilise local storage~~ (~~MainContent~~, ~~Education~~, ~~SkillsAndInterest~~, ~~Section~~).
   7. ~~Add reset to default / filler values button in nav bar of each section.~~
   8. ~~Fix contact inputs.~~
   9. ~~Add a hover effect on section when user hovers over Remove button.~~
   10. ~~Add Editing / Viewing mode.~~
   11. Print to PDF.
   12. ~~Make main nav stick.~~
   13. ~~Make it responsive.~~
   14. ~~Move the main nav bar outside of the A4 document.~~

3. Bugs
   1. ~~Fix education-section sizing issue when removing bullet points.~~
