# Notes for myself.

1. Complete the app
2. Thinking of implementing the following features:

   1. ~~Add/remove bullet points.~~
   2. ~~Add/remove additional sections (ensure Education, Experience and Skills remain at a minimum).~~
   3. ~~Move sections up/down.~~
   4. ~~Delete field if user leaves as blank (in SkillsAndInterests component).~~
   5. ~~Add focus on new entry for SkillsAndInterests component (either add focus or just add placeholder).~~
   6. Utilise local storage (~~MainContent~~, ~~Education~~, SkillsAndInterest, Section).
   7. Add a hover effect on section when user hovers over Remove button.
   8. Add Editing / Viewing mode.
   9. Print to PDF.
   10. Share to others.
   11. Email to yourself.

3. Bugs
   1. ~~Fix education-section sizing issue when removing bullet points.~~
