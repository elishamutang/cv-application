# CV Application

Developed a CV application that presents the user with a simple CV template (courtesy of [Harvard College](https://careerservices.fas.harvard.edu/resources/bullet-point-resume-template/)) to create a CV in minutes!

Main motivation to start this project was to learn React and state management using useState, and also other React Hooks such as useEffect and useRef.
