# CV Application

Currently building a CV application that presents the user with a simple CV template (courtesy of [Harvard College](https://careerservices.fas.harvard.edu/resources/bullet-point-resume-template/)) for users to quickly create a CV.

Main motivation to start this project was to learn a new technology, specifically the React library.
